Title: HDF5-backed DataFrame objects and methods
Description: 
    Implements bindings for h5 files that are compatible with Bioconductor
    S4 data structures, namely the DataFrame and DelayedArray. This allows 
    HDF5-backed data to be easily used as data frames with arbitrary sets 
    of columns.
